# 01 - Feasibility Study

## Overview

A feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis conducted before starting a project to determine whether the proposed system is viable and worth pursuing. It evaluates technical, economic, operational, and organizational aspects.

## Types of Feasibility

### Technical Feasibility
- **Technology Assessment:** Available technology evaluation
- **Resource Requirements:** Hardware, software, and personnel needs
- **Technical Expertise:** Team capability assessment
- **Integration Possibilities:** System integration with existing infrastructure

### Economic Feasibility (Cost-Benefit Analysis)
- **Development Costs:** Initial investment requirements
- **Operational Costs:** Ongoing maintenance and support expenses
- **Benefit Quantification:** Tangible and intangible benefits
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Financial viability assessment
- **Break-even Analysis:** Time to recover investment

### Operational Feasibility
- **Business Process Impact:** Effect on current operations
- **User Acceptance:** Willingness to adopt new system
- **Organizational Culture:** Compatibility with company culture
- **Training Requirements:** User training and support needs

### Legal Feasibility
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Legal and regulatory requirements
- **Intellectual Property:** IP rights and licensing considerations
- **Data Privacy:** Privacy laws and data protection
- **Contractual Obligations:** Legal agreements and contracts

### Schedule Feasibility
- **Time Constraints:** Project timeline requirements
- **Resource Availability:** Team and resource availability
- **Dependencies:** External factor dependencies
- **Milestone Achievement:** Realistic deadline assessment

## Feasibility Study Process

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Methods

### Net Present Value (NPV)
- **Formula:** NPV = Σ (Benefits - Costs) / (1 + r)^t
- **Decision Rule:** Positive NPV indicates viable project
- **Time Value:** Accounts for time value of money
- **Risk Adjustment:** Incorporates risk factors

### Return on Investment (ROI)
- **Formula:** ROI = (Net Benefits / Total Costs) × 100
- **Break-even Point:** When cumulative benefits equal costs
- **Payback Period:** Time to recover initial investment
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** Discount rate where NPV = 0

### Cost Categories
- **Direct Costs:** Hardware, software, personnel
- **Indirect Costs:** Training, downtime, overhead
- **Intangible Benefits:** Improved customer satisfaction, competitive advantage
- **Risk Costs:** Contingency planning and mitigation

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Identification
- **Technical Risks:** Technology obsolescence, integration issues
- **Financial Risks:** Cost overruns, budget constraints
- **Operational Risks:** User resistance, process changes
- **External Risks:** Market changes, regulatory changes

### Risk Analysis
- **Probability Assessment:** Likelihood of risk occurrence
- **Impact Evaluation:** Potential consequences
- **Risk Prioritization:** High, medium, low classification
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Prevention and contingency plans
