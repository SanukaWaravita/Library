# 01 - Requirements Fundamentals

## Overview

Requirements engineering is the process of discovering, documenting, and maintaining requirements for a software system. It bridges the gap between user needs and system implementation, ensuring the final product meets stakeholder expectations.

## Requirements Engineering Process

### 1. Requirements Elicitation
**Activities:**
- Stakeholder identification and analysis
- Requirement gathering through interviews, workshops, and observation
- Existing system analysis and user feedback collection
- Market research and competitive analysis

**Techniques:**
- Interviews and questionnaires
- Focus groups and workshops
- Prototyping and demonstrations
- Use case development
- Observation and ethnography

### 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification
**Activities:**
- Requirement classification and prioritization
- Conflict resolution and negotiation
- Requirement validation and verification
- Formal specification development

**Deliverables:**
- Requirements specification document
- Use case specifications
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Requirements validation reports

### 3. Requirements Validation
**Activities:**
- Requirement review and inspection
- Prototyping and simulation
- User acceptance testing preparation
- Requirements baseline establishment

**Techniques:**
- Requirements reviews
- Prototyping and mockups
- Model validation
- Acceptance criteria definition

### 4. Requirements Management
**Activities:**
- Requirement change control
- Version control and configuration management
- Traceability maintenance
- Impact analysis for changes

**Deliverables:**
- Requirements change log
- Updated requirements documents
- Impact analysis reports
- Requirements status reports

## Requirements Types

### Functional Requirements
- **Definition:** What the system must do
- **Characteristics:** Actions, processes, data transformations
- **Examples:** User authentication, data processing, report generation
- **Specification:** Use cases, functional specifications

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Definition:** How well the system performs its functions
- **Categories:** Performance, security, usability, reliability, maintainability
- **Examples:** Response time, data security, user interface standards
- **Specification:** Quality attributes, constraints, standards

### Business Requirements
- **Definition:** High-level business objectives
- **Characteristics:** Business goals, success criteria, business rules
- **Examples:** Increase sales by 20%, reduce processing time
- **Specification:** Business case, success metrics

### User Requirements
- **Definition:** User-specific needs and expectations
- **Characteristics:** User goals, tasks, preferences
- **Examples:** Easy navigation, intuitive interface, quick access
- **Specification:** User stories, personas, scenarios

### System Requirements
- **Definition:** Detailed system capabilities and constraints
- **Characteristics:** Technical specifications, interfaces, data requirements
- **Examples:** Database capacity, API specifications, hardware requirements
- **Specification:** System architecture, interface specifications

## Requirements Quality Criteria

### Completeness
- **Coverage:** All required functionality specified
- **Consistency:** No conflicting requirements
- **Traceability:** Requirements linked to sources and rationale
- **Feasibility:** Technically and economically achievable

### Correctness
- **Accuracy:** Requirements accurately reflect needs
- **Validity:** Requirements verifiable and testable
- **Consistency:** Requirements don't contradict each other
- **Realism:** Requirements achievable within constraints

### Clarity and Precision
- **Unambiguous:** Single interpretation possible
- **Concise:** No unnecessary information
- **Understandable:** Clear to all stakeholders
- **Precise:** Exact meaning without vagueness

### Modifiability
- **Structured:** Easy to modify and update
- **Traceable:** Changes tracked and documented
- **Versioned:** Change history maintained
- **Impact Analysis:** Change effects assessable

## Requirements Documentation

### Requirements Specification Document
- **Introduction:** Purpose, scope, definitions
- **Overall Description:** Product perspective, user characteristics
- **Specific Requirements:** External interface, functional, non-functional
- **Appendices:** Analysis models, traceability matrices

### Use Case Specifications
- **Use Case Name:** Clear, descriptive identifier
- **Actors:** System users and external systems
- **Preconditions:** Required system state
- **Main Flow:** Primary success scenario
- **Alternative Flows:** Exception and variation scenarios
- **Postconditions:** System state after execution

### Requirements Traceability Matrix
- **Requirement ID:** Unique requirement identifier
- **Description:** Requirement summary
- **Source:** Origin of requirement
- **Priority:** Business importance
- **Status:** Current implementation status
- **Test Case:** Associated test cases

## Requirements Engineering Challenges

### Communication Issues
- **Stakeholder Diversity:** Different backgrounds and perspectives
- **Terminology Problems:** Different meanings for same terms
- **Requirement Ambiguity:** Vague or incomplete specifications
- **Changing Requirements:** Evolving user needs and business conditions

### Technical Challenges
- **Complexity Management:** Large system requirement handling
