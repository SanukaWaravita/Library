# 1. Classification by Elements:

- **Physical System:** Tangible, operational components (*e.g., Assembly line, HVAC system*).
    
- **Abstract System:** Conceptual, based on ideas (*e.g., Organizational hierarchy, Software algorithm*).


# 2. Classification by Interaction with Environment:

- **Open System:** Interacts freely with its environment (*e.g., Business organization, Human body*).
    
- **Closed System:** Self-contained, minimal interaction (*e.g., A sealed chemical reaction, Legacy software with no API*).


# 3. Classification by Human Intervention:

- **Manual System:** Human-operated (*e.g., Paper-based filing, Hand-written ledgers*).
    
- **Automated System:** Machine/computer-operated (*e.g., Robotic assembly, Database server*).
    
- **Semi-Automated:** Hybrid (*e.g., ATM - human inputs, machine processes).
