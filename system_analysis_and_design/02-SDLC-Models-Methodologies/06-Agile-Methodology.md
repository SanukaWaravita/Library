# 06 - Agile Methodology

## Overview

Agile Methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It focuses on delivering working software frequently and responding to changing requirements.

## Core Principles (Agile Manifesto)

### 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- People and communication valued over rigid processes
- Team collaboration emphasized
- Face-to-face communication preferred
- Flexible tool adoption

### 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
- Functional software prioritized over extensive documentation
- "Working software is the primary measure of progress"
- Minimal necessary documentation
- Just enough documentation approach

### 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Active customer involvement throughout development
- Collaborative relationship building
- Regular feedback and adjustment
- Partnership approach

### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan
- Embracing changing requirements
- Adaptive planning processes
- Flexibility in responding to change
- Change as competitive advantage

## Agile Frameworks

### Scrum
- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Ceremonies:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Time-boxed iterations** called Sprints (2-4 weeks)

### Kanban
- **Visual workflow management**
- **Work in Progress (WIP) limits**
- **Pull system** rather than push
- **Continuous flow** without fixed iterations
- **Focus on bottleneck reduction**

### Extreme Programming (XP)
- **Pair programming**
- **Test-driven development (TDD)**
- **Continuous integration**
- **Refactoring**
- **Simple design principles**

## Development Process

### 1. Project Initiation
- Vision and scope definition
- Initial backlog creation
- Team formation
- Environment setup

### 2. Iteration Planning
- Sprint/backlog item selection
- Task breakdown and estimation
- Commitment and capacity planning
- Sprint goal definition

### 3. Development Cycle
- Daily collaboration and coordination
- Continuous integration and testing
- Regular customer feedback
- Adaptive planning and adjustment

### 4. Delivery and Review
- Working software demonstration
- Customer feedback collection
- Retrospective and improvement
- Next iteration planning

## Advantages

- Continuous integration
- Automated testing
- Code quality standards

## When to Use Agile

### Suitable Projects
- Dynamic requirements environments
- Innovative or exploratory projects
- Customer collaboration possible
- Small to medium-sized teams
- Fast-moving market conditions

### Project Characteristics
- Uncertain or changing requirements
- Customer available for feedback
- Team experienced in agile practices
- Short delivery cycles desired
- Innovation and experimentation needed

## Scaling Agile

### Scrum of Scrums
- Coordination between multiple Scrum teams
- Daily Scrum of Scrums meetings
- Integration and dependency management
- Cross-team communication

### Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
- Scaling Scrum to large organizations
- Multiple teams working on same product
- Shared product backlog
- Cross-team coordination

### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
- Comprehensive scaling framework
- Multiple levels of planning
- Program and portfolio management
- Enterprise-level coordination

## Common Challenges

### Adoption Issues
- Organizational culture resistance
- Management mindset shift
- Process discipline requirements
- Training and coaching needs

### Scaling Problems
- Coordination complexity
- Communication overhead
- Integration challenges
- Consistency maintenance

## Success Factors

### Organizational Factors
