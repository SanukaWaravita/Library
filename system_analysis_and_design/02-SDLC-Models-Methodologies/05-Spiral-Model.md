# 05 - Spiral Model

## Overview

The Spiral Model combines elements of iterative development with systematic risk management. It emphasizes risk assessment and reduction through multiple iterations, making it suitable for large, complex projects where risk management is critical.

## Core Principles

### Risk-Driven Approach
- Risk identification and analysis
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Iterative risk reduction
- Prototyping for risk assessment

### Four Quadrants
Each cycle consists of four phases:
1. **Determine Objectives** - Define requirements and constraints
2. **Risk Analysis** - Identify and resolve risks
3. **Development & Testing** - Develop and validate increment
4. **Planning** - Plan next iteration

## Spiral Structure

### Cycle 1: Proof of Concept
**Objectives:** Basic feasibility and requirements
**Risks:** Technology, requirements, concept
**Development:** Core functionality prototype
**Planning:** Detailed requirements and design

### Cycle 2: Core System
**Objectives:** System architecture and core functionality
**Risks:** Design, integration, performance
**Development:** Architectural prototype
**Planning:** System design and implementation

### Cycle 3: System Refinement
**Objectives:** Complete system with refinements
**Risks:** Interface, usability, scalability
**Development:** Working system prototype
**Planning:** Testing and deployment

### Cycle 4+: Enhancement Cycles
**Objectives:** Additional features and optimizations
**Risks:** Performance, reliability, maintenance
**Development:** Production system
**Planning:** Maintenance and enhancement
