# 07 - Scrum & Kanban Overview

## Overview

Scrum and Kanban are two popular Agile frameworks that provide structured approaches to managing complex work. While Scrum uses fixed time-boxed iterations, Kanban focuses on continuous flow and work-in-progress limits.

## Scrum Framework

### Core Components

#### Roles
- **Product Owner:** Represents stakeholders, manages product backlog, prioritizes work
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates Scrum processes, removes impediments, coaches team
- **Development Team:** Cross-functional group that delivers potentially releasable increments

#### Events (Ceremonies)
- **Sprint Planning:** Team plans work for upcoming sprint (2-4 hours for 2-week sprint)
- **Daily Scrum:** 15-minute daily synchronization meeting
- **Sprint Review:** Demonstration of completed work and feedback collection
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Team reflects on past sprint and identifies improvements

#### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog:** Living list of all potential work, prioritized by value
- **Sprint Backlog:** Selected items from product backlog for current sprint
- **Increment:** Sum of all completed product backlog items at end of sprint

### Sprint Cycle
```
Sprint Planning → Development → Daily Scrum → Sprint Review → Sprint Retrospective → Next Sprint
```

### Key Practices
- **Time-boxing:** All events have fixed time limits
- **Sprint Goal:** Clear objective for each sprint
- **Definition of Done:** Clear criteria for work completion
- **Burndown Charts:** Visual progress tracking
- **Velocity:** Measure of team productivity

## Kanban Framework

### Core Principles

#### Visual Workflow
- **Kanban Board:** Visual representation of work flow
- **Columns:** Represent different stages of work (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Cards:** Represent individual work items
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits:** Maximum items allowed in each column

#### Pull System
- Work is "pulled" when capacity becomes available
- No work pushed onto team without capacity
- Focus on completing current work before starting new
- Sustainable pace maintenance

### Key Metrics
- **Lead Time:** Time from work start to completion
- **Cycle Time:** Time spent actively working on item
- **Throughput:** Number of items completed per time period
- **Work in Progress:** Current items in process

## Scrum vs Kanban Comparison

### Structure
- **Scrum:** Prescriptive framework with defined roles, events, and artifacts
- **Kanban:** Flexible method focused on workflow visualization and limits

### Iteration Approach
- **Scrum:** Fixed time-boxed iterations (Sprints)
- **Kanban:** Continuous flow without fixed iterations

### Planning
- **Scrum:** Sprint planning for fixed time periods
- **Kanban:** Just-in-time planning based on capacity

### Roles
- **Scrum:** Defined roles (PO, SM, Team)
- **Kanban:** No prescribed roles, team self-organizes

### Metrics
- **Scrum:** Velocity, sprint burndown
- **Kanban:** Lead time, cycle time, throughput

## Hybrid Approaches

### Scrum with Kanban Elements
- Scrum ceremonies with Kanban board visualization
- WIP limits within sprints
- Continuous flow within time-boxed iterations
- Best of both worlds approach

### Kanban with Scrum Elements
- Kanban flow with sprint planning
- Regular retrospectives
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Structured improvement processes

## Implementation Best Practices

### Getting Started with Scrum
1. **Form Scrum Team:** Identify Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team
2. **Create Product Backlog:** Gather and prioritize initial requirements
3. **Plan First Sprint:** Select items and create Sprint Backlog
4. **Establish Cadence:** Set up regular ceremonies and time-boxes
5. **Track Progress:** Use burndown charts and velocity metrics

### Getting Started with Kanban
1. **Map Current Process:** Visualize existing workflow
2. **Create Kanban Board:** Set up columns representing work states
3. **Set WIP Limits:** Establish capacity limits for each column
4. **Track Metrics:** Monitor lead time, cycle time, and throughput
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and optimize flow

## Common Challenges

### Scrum Challenges
- **Sprint Planning:** Selecting appropriate amount of work
- **Sprint Goals:** Maintaining focus and commitment
- **Daily Stand-ups:** Keeping meetings efficient and valuable
- **Product Owner Role:** Balancing stakeholder needs with team capacity

### Kanban Challenges
- **WIP Limits:** Setting appropriate limits for team capacity
- **Bottleneck Management:** Identifying and resolving workflow blockages
- **Continuous Flow:** Maintaining steady pace without sprint pressure
- **Metrics Usage:** Interpreting and acting on flow metrics

## Success Factors

### Team Factors
- **Cross-functional Skills:** Ability to handle multiple types of work
- **Self-organization:** Team autonomy and decision-making
- **Collaboration:** Strong communication and cooperation
- **Continuous Learning:** Regular improvement and adaptation

### Process Factors
- **Transparency:** Clear visibility into work and progress
- **Feedback Loops:** Regular review and adjustment
- **Quality Focus:** Built-in quality practices and standards
- **Flexibility:** Ability to adapt to changing conditions

## Scaling Considerations

### Multiple Teams
- **Scrum of Scrums:** Coordination between Scrum teams
- **Meta Scrum:** Higher-level coordination and integration
- **Shared Backlogs:** Common product vision across teams

### Large Organizations
- **Portfolio Kanban:** Managing multiple projects/programs
- **Service Delivery:** Managing ongoing support and maintenance
- **Enterprise Agile:** Scaling agile practices across organization

## Tool Support

### Scrum Tools
- Jira, Azure DevOps, Rally
- Physical boards and sticky notes
- Excel/Google Sheets for simple tracking
- Specialized Scrum software

### Kanban Tools
- Trello, Jira, Azure Boards
- Physical Kanban boards
- LeanKit, Kanbanize
- Custom dashboards and visualizations

**Key Takeaway:** Scrum provides structure and cadence for complex projects, while Kanban offers flexibility and flow optimization. Choose based on team needs, project complexity, and organizational context.
