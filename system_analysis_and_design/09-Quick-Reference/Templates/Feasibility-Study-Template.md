## Template Usage Guidelines

### Feasibility Study Process
1. **Define Scope:** Clearly bound the study scope and objectives
2. **Gather Data:** Collect accurate cost, benefit, and technical information
3. **Analyze Alternatives:** Evaluate multiple solution approaches
4. **Assess Risks:** Identify and quantify project risks
5. **Document Findings:** Provide clear, objective analysis
6. **Make Recommendations:** State clear go/no-go decision criteria

### Key Success Factors
- **Objectivity:** Base analysis on facts, not assumptions
- **Comprehensiveness:** Cover all feasibility aspects thoroughly
- **Accuracy:** Use reliable data sources and realistic estimates
- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Include all relevant stakeholders
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of analysis and assumptions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Optimism Bias:** Unrealistically positive cost or benefit estimates
- **Scope Creep:** Allowing the study to expand beyond its boundaries
- **Incomplete Analysis:** Missing key feasibility aspects
- **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking data that supports preconceived notions
- **Poor Documentation:** Failing to document assumptions and limitations

### Feasibility Study Timeline
- **Small Projects:** 1-2 weeks
- **Medium Projects:** 2-4 weeks
- **Large Projects:** 4-8 weeks
- **Complex Projects:** 8-12 weeks
