# 1. What is a User Story?

- A simple, concise description of a feature from the end-user's perspective.

- **Format:** `As a [role], I want [action] so that [benefit].`


# 2. The Three-Part Structure (From Notes):

- As a... (The end user who directly interacts with the system)

    *Examples: student, customer, admin, driver*

- I want... (The expectation or desired action)

    *Examples: "to reset my password", "to filter search results"*

- So that... (The business value or personal benefit)

    *Examples: "so I can regain account access", "so I can find relevant products faster"*


# 3. Key Principle: Atomic Stories

- **"Keep user stories atomic. The more stories, the more $."**

- **Atomic** = One story, one feature, one value.

- **Bad:** "As a user, I want to manage my profile, settings, and notifications..."

- **Good:**

    1. "As a user, I want to update my email address so my account is secure."
    
    2. "As a user, I want to set notification preferences so I'm not overwhelmed."
    
    3. "As a user, I want to upload a profile picture so others can recognize me."


# 4. Acceptance Criteria (The "Definition of Done"):

- The conditions that must be met for the story to be complete.

- **Example for "Reset Password":**

    1. User receives email with reset link within 2 minutes.
    2. Link expires after 24 hours.
    3. New password must meet security requirements.
    4. User is automatically logged in after reset.


# 5. Why This Matters in SAD:

- **User-Centered:** Focuses on what users actually need.

- **Testable:** Clear criteria for QA/testing.

- **Estimatable:** Developers can better estimate effort for small, clear stories.

- **Traceable:** Links user needs to business goals.


# 6. Lecture Insight: Dual Alignment

- User stories must satisfy both:

    1. **End-user needs** (the "I want" part)
    2. **Business goals** (the "so that" part)

- **Example:** "As a customer, I want one-click reordering so that I save time" → **Business Benefit:** Increased repeat sales.
