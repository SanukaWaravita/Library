## Overview

The **MoSCoW Priority Method** is a powerful prioritization framework used to reach consensus with stakeholders on what will and won't be delivered in a project iteration or release. It's crucial for managing scope, expectations, and resource allocation effectively.

**Origin:** Developed by Dai Clegg at Oracle for rapid application development  
**Key Benefit:** *Transforms subjective priorities into objective delivery decisions*

## The Four Priority Categories

### Priority Matrix with Decision Criteria

| Category | Description | Delivery % | Decision Criteria | Resource Allocation |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **🔴 MUST HAVE** | Non-negotiable requirements. System cannot function without these. | 100% | Business-critical, legal compliance, system won't work without it | Highest priority, dedicated resources |
| **🟡 SHOULD HAVE** | Important but not vital. Strongly desired but workarounds exist. | ~80% | Significant business value, user satisfaction impact | Secondary priority, shared resources |
| **🟢 COULD HAVE** | Nice-to-have. Desirable but not necessary. Low impact if omitted. | ~20% | Marginal improvement, competitive advantage | Lowest priority, leftover resources |
| **⚪ WON'T HAVE** | Explicitly out of scope for this release (but maybe future). | 0% | Beyond current capacity, future consideration | No current resources, future planning |

### Implementation Flow & Strategy

**Key Memory Device:**
- **MoSCoW** = In Scope (M, S, C)
- **COW** = Out of Current Scope (C partial delivery, W completely out)
- **Flow:** MUST → (if resources allow) → SHOULD → (if resources allow) → COULD


# 4. Practical Application in SAD:

- **After Requirements Gathering:** Classify each requirement as M/S/C/W.

- **During Client Negotiation:** "We can deliver all MUSTs and 80% of SHOULDs within budget."

- **Scope Control:** When new requests come: "Is this a MUST or SHOULD? If C or W, it goes to next phase."


# 5. *Example: University LMS Feature Prioritization*

- ***MUST:** User login, course enrollment, grade submission.*

- ***SHOULD:** Mobile app, discussion forums, calendar sync.*

- ***COULD:** Gamification badges, AI tutoring suggestions.*

- ***WON'T:** Virtual reality classrooms, blockchain credentialing (for V1).*
