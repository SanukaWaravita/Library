***Tag:*** *#Classification #Theory*

# 1. Classification by Elements:

- **Physical System:** Tangible, operational components (*e.g., Assembly line, HVAC system*).
    
- **Abstract System:** Conceptual, based on ideas (*e.g., Organizational hierarchy, Software algorithm*).


# 2. Classification by Interaction with Environment:

- **Open System:** Interacts freely with its environment (*e.g., Business organization, Human body*).
    
- **Closed System:** Self-contained, minimal interaction (*e.g., A sealed chemical reaction, Legacy software with no API*).


# 3. Classification by Human Intervention:

- **Manual System:** Human-operated (*e.g., Paper-based filing, Hand-written ledgers*).
    
- **Automated System:** Machine/computer-operated (*e.g., Robotic assembly, Database server*).
    
- **Semi-Automated:** Hybrid (*e.g., ATM - human inputs, machine processes).

# 4. Classification by Output Predictability:

- **Deterministic System:** Output is predictable and certain (*e.g., Calculator, Elevator control*).
    
- **Probabilistic (Stochastic) System:** Output involves chance/uncertainty (*e.g., Weather forecasting, Stock market analysis*).

# 5. Quick-Reference Classification Table:

| Criteria | Type 1 | Type 2 | Example | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Elements | Physical | Abstract | Factory Vs. Business Plan |
| Interaction | Open | Closed| University Vs. Sealed Experiment | 
| Intervention | Manual | Automated | Paper Form Vs. Barcode Scanner | 
| Output | Deterministic | Probabillistic | Payroll System Vs. Sales Forecast | 

# 7. Why Classification Matters:

- Helps choose the right analysis and design approach.

- Determines the level of automation and control needed.

- Influences testing and validation strategies.
