# 1. Detailed Component Breakdown:

| COMPONENT | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE | 
|---|---|---|
| Inputs | Data, materials, energy, or requests from the environment | ***(For a Food Delivery App):*** *Customer order, payment details, location* | 
| Processes (Transformation) | <ul><li>The "work" of the system. Can be: <ul><li><b>Physical:</b> Manufacturing, sorting.</li><li><b>Informational:</b> Calculating, validating, routing.</li><li><b>Business:</b> Approving, notifying.</li></ul></li></ul> | *Validating payment, assigning driver, updating kitchen* |
| Outputs | <ul><li>The delivered result. Can be:</li><ul><li><b>Tangible:</b> Product, report.</li><li><b>Intangible:</b> Service, confirmation message.</li></ul></ul> | *Confirmed order ID, driver assignment notification, recept.* |
| Feedback (The Control Loop) | <ul><li>Information about outputs fed back to adjust inputs/ processes.</li><li>Types:</li><ul><li><b>Positive Feedback:</b> Amplifies change (<i>e.g. stock buying trends</i>).</li><li><b>Negative Feedback:</b> Corrects deviation (<i>e.g. thermostat, error message</i>).</li></ul></ul> | *Driver rating affecting future assignments; order cancellation rate triggering process review. | 
| Boundary | <ul>Defines the scope of the system. Crucial for managing complexity.</ul> | *The delivery app's boundary includes the app, driver app, and restaurant interface - but not the bank's payment system (an external entity).* | 
| Environment | <ul><li>Everything outside the boundary. Can be:</li><ul><li><b>Stable:</b> Rarely changes (laws of phyiscs).</li><li><b>Dynamic:</b> Constantly changes (market trends, user behaviour).</li></ul></ul> | |


# 3. Application in SAD:

- **As-Is Analysis:** Map the current system using this model.
    
- **To-Be Design:** Design the future system's components explicitly.
    
- **Identifying Issues:** Look for broken feedback loops, poor boundary definition, or weak inputs/outputs.


# 4. Case Study: University Registration System

- **Inputs:** Student ID, selected courses, prerequisites.

- **Process:** Check seat availability, validate prerequisites, calculate fees.

- **Outputs:** Class schedule, invoice, confirmation email.

- **Feedback:** "Course full" notification, waitlist option, student satisfaction survey.


# 5. Common Pitfalls:

- **Boundary Creep:** Including too much in the system scope.
    
- **Missing Feedback:** Designing systems that can't adapt.
    
- **Ignoring Environment:** Not accounting for external changes (new regulations, tech shifts).
