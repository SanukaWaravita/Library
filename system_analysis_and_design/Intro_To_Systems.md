1. **Official Definition:**
    - A **system** is a set of interrelated components that work together to achieve a common goal by accepting inputs, processing them, and producing outputs within a defined boundary.

2. **Key Characteristics (The "System DNA"):**
    - **Boundary:** Separates the system from its environment.
    
    - **Inputs:** Data, material, or energy received from the environment.
        
    - **Processes:** Activities that transform inputs into outputs.
        
    - **Outputs:** Results (products, services, information) delivered to the environment.
        
    - **Feedback:** Information about the output used to adjust the system (control mechanism).
        
    - **Environment:** Everything outside the system's boundary that interacts with it.

4. **Real-World Examples Table:**

| System| Input| Process| Output| Feedback Mechanism|
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ATM| Card, PIN, Request| Verify account, Check balance, Dispense logic| Cash, Receipt, Updated balance| Screen displays success/failure; receipt confirms transaction|
| Traffic Light Control| Vehicle sensor data, Time of day| Timing algorithm, Priority logic| Red/Yellow/Green signals| Traffic cameras monitor flow; timers adjust based on congestion|
| University LMS| Student login, Assignment upload| Authentication, File storage, Grade calculation| Course content, Grades, Notifications| Student performance data used to adjust teaching materials|
