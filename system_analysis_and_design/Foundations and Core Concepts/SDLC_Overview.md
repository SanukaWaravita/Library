***Tag:*** *#Framework #Process #SDLC*

# 1. What is the SDLC?

- **Definition:** A structured, phased process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying information systems.

- **Purpose:** To produce high-quality software that meets user expectations, on time and within budget.

- **Core Idea:** Break down development into manageable, sequential stages with clear deliverables.

# 2. Why is the SDLC Important?

- **Systematic Development:** Reduces chaos and "code-and-fix" approaches.

- **Improves Quality:** Built-in validation and testing phases.

- **Manages Risk:** Identifies issues early (cheaper to fix).

- **Enhances Communication:** Clear deliverables at each stage align stakeholders.

- Provides Control: Milestones and reviews keep project on track.

# 3. Generic SDLC Phases (The "Big Picture"):

- **Planning & Feasibility:** "Should we do this project?"

- **Analysis:** "What do we need to build?"

- **Design:** "How will we build it?"

- **Implementation (Development):** "Building it."

- **Testing:** "Did we build it correctly?"

- **Deployment:** "Releasing it to users."

- **Maintenance:** "Keeping it running and improving it."

# 4. The Phase-Deliverable Concept:

- Each phase produces specific deliverables (documents, diagrams, code, reports).

- Example Deliverables:

    - **Planning:** Feasibility Study Report, Project Charter.

    - **Analysis:** Requirements Specification Document, Use Case Diagrams.

    - **Design:** System Architecture Document, Database Schema, UI Mockups.

    - **Testing:** Test Plans, Bug Reports.

    - **Deployment:** User Manuals, Training Materials.

# 5. Iteration in the SDLC:

- Not all projects are linear. Many models (Agile, Spiral) use iterations—repeating cycles of design-build-test.

- **Key Idea:** Get feedback early and often, refine the system incrementally.

# 6. Predictive Vs. Adaptive SDLC Approaches:

| Aspect | Predictive (Plan-Driven) | Adaptive (Change-Driven) | 
|---|---|---|
| Philosophy | Plan the whole project upfront | Plan as you go, adapt to change |
| Requirements | Stable, well-understood | Volatile, evolving | 
| Feedback | At major milestones | Continuous, every iteration | 
| Examples | Waterfall, V-Model | Agile, Scrum, XP | 
| Best For | Safety-critical systems, construction | Startups, web apps, fast-changing markets | 

# 7. In-Class Discussion Prompt:

*"Think of an app you use frequently (e.g. Instagram, Spotifiy). What might one SDLC iteration for a new feature (like 'Stories' or 'Dialy Mix') have looked like?"*
