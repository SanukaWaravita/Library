# 1. What is MoSCoW?

- A prioritization framework used to reach consensus with stakeholders on **what will and won't be delivered**.

- Crucial for managing **scope**, **expectations**, and **resources**.


# 2. The Four Categories:

| Cateogry | Description | % Typically Included | 
| M - MUST HAVE | Non-negotiable requirements. System cannot function without these. | 100% | 
| S - SHOULD HAVE | Important but not vital. Strongly desired but workarounds exist. | ~80% | 
| C - COULD HAVE | Nice-to-have. Desirable but not necessary. Low impact if omitted. | ~20% |
| W - WON'T HAVE | Explicitly out of scope for this release (but maybe future). | 0% |


# 3. Menomic & Flow:

- **MoSCoW** = In Scope

- **COW** = Out of Scope

- Implementation Flow:
    
    - MUST → (if time/cost allows) → SHOULD → (if time/cost allows) → COULD
    - WON'T = Never in this version


# 4. Practical Application in SAD:

- **After Requirements Gathering:** Classify each requirement as M/S/C/W.

- **During Client Negotiation:** "We can deliver all MUSTs and 80% of SHOULDs within budget."

- **Scope Control:** When new requests come: "Is this a MUST or SHOULD? If C or W, it goes to next phase."


# 5. *Example: University LMS Feature Prioritization*

- ***MUST:** User login, course enrollment, grade submission.*

- ***SHOULD:** Mobile app, discussion forums, calendar sync.*

- ***COULD:** Gamification badges, AI tutoring suggestions.*

- ***WON'T:** Virtual reality classrooms, blockchain credentialing (for V1).*
