# 1. The Three Main Types (From Notes):

# 2. Business Requirements (The "WHY")

- High-level organizational goals.

-**Stakeholders:** CEOs, Managers.

- **Format:** SMART objectives.

    *Example: "Increase local artisan sales by 10% within 1 year."*


# 3. User Requirements (The "WHO needs WHAT")

- End-user needs and expectations.

- **Format:** User Stories (As a... I want... So that...).

    *Example: "As an artisan, I want to list products online so I can reach more customers."*


# 4. System Requirements (The "WHAT & HOW" of the system)

- Detailed specifications of what the system must do and how.

- **Two Subtypes:**

    - **Functional Requirements:** Features, functions, executable parts.

        *Example: "System shall allow users to search products by category."*

    - **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** System qualities, constraints, "environmental variables."

        - Analogy from notes: "The bottle mouth size" that controls flow.

            *Example: "System shall load search results in <2 seconds for 1000+ users."*


# 5. The Critical Relationship:

- **Business Requirements** drive **User Requirements**.

- **User Requirements** translate into **System Requirements**.

- **Functional Features** must satisfy **both** user needs AND business goals.


# 6. The "Problem Statement" Focus (From Notes):

- **Golden Rule:** "Our solution has to be for the problem statement only."

- **Don't over-engineer:** "Do make systems to solve all world problems." ← (Sarcastic warning against scope creep)
