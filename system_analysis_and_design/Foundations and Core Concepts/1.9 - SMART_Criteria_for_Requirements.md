# 1. What is SMART?

- A framework to ensure Business Requirements are well-defined, actionable, and measurable.


# 2. The SMART Acronym

| Letter | Stands For | What It Means | Example (Poor → SMART) | 
|---|---|---|---|
| S | Specific | Clear, unambiguous, focused | "Imporve sales" → "Increase online sales by 15%" |
| M | Measurable | Quantifiable, trackable | "Better service" → "Reduce support tickets by 30%" |
| A | Achievable | Realistic, feasible within constraints | "100% market share" → "Gain 5% market share" | 
| R | Relevant | Aligns with business goals | Hospital system tracking canteen sales → ❌ Irrelevant | 
| T | Time-bound | Has a deadline | "Someday" → "Within Q3 2024" |


# 3. Business Requirements Should Be:

- **Specific:** "Increase customer base by 25%" (not "get more customers")

- **Measurable:** Use numbers (quantitative), not vague "goodness" (qualitative)

- **Achievable:** Don't promise impossible 25% growth in 5 days

- **Relevant:** Hospital system should improve patient care, not track cafeteria income

- **Time-bound:** "Within 6 months of launch"


# 4. Why SMART Matters in SAD:

- **Prevents Ambiguity:** Clear targets for the development team.

- **Enables Validation:** You can test if the requirement was met.

- **Aligns Stakeholders:** Everyone agrees on what success looks like.

- **Supports ROI Calculation:** Measurable benefits vs. costs.
