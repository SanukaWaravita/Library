# 1. System Analysis

- **Definition:** The process of studying an existing system (or business need) to identify its objectives, requirements, and problems.

- **Focus:** Understanding the "what" and "why".

- **Key Question:** "What does the business need, and what problems are we solving?"

- **Activities:** Gathering requirements, analyzing processes, modeling current systems, identifying gaps.


# 2. System Design

- **Definition:** The process of planning and specifying a new system that meets the requirements identified during analysis.

- **Focus:** Creating the "how".

- **Key Question:** "How will we build a system to meet these needs?"

- **Activities:** Architectural design, interface design, database design, specifying software/hardware.

# 4. Importance of SAD

- **Aligns IT with Business Goals:** Ensures technology solutions solve real business problems.

- **Manages Complexity:** Breaks down large problems into manageable parts.

- **Reduces Risk:** Identifies issues before building (saves time/money).

- **Improves Communication:** Creates common language between stakeholders (business users ↔ technical team).

- **Ensures Quality:** Structured approach leads to robust, maintainable systems.


# 5. SAD Mindset: Think like an Analysis

- **Be Problem-Oriented, Not Solution-Jumping:** Understand the root cause first.

- **See the Big Picture & the Details:** (Forest and the trees).

- **Communicate in Multiple "Languages":** Business talk, technical specs, visual models.

- **Embrace Change:** Requirements evolve; design must adapt.


# 6. Real-world analogy: Building a House

- **Analysis:** Talking to family about needs (# bedrooms, kitchen style, budget), surveying land, checking zoning laws.

- **Design:** Creating architectural blueprints, electrical plans, material lists.

- **Without SAD:** You'd start building and hope it works out.


# 7. The Systems Analyst Role

***Tag:*** *#Roles #Skills #Career*

1. Who is a Systems Analyst?
